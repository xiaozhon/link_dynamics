Process the testbed data, find the characteristics of network dynamics.

***************************************************************************
A. find the dynamics of the link quality

Find the periods when most of the nodes are alive to have a complete set of
data.

Select some typical nodes whose data packets are complete. 
	- <src, parent> pair
	
Summary & routing data do not have temperature and humidity. 
	- 1. leave them along
	- 2. use the average temperature from the nearby packets
	
Draw the relationship between temperature and RSSI.
